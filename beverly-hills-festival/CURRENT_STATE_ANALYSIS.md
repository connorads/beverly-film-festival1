# Beverly Hills Film Festival - Current State Analysis

## Working Components

1. **Home Page** (http://localhost:3000/)
   - ✅ Loads successfully
   - ✅ Shows demo mode banner with test credentials
   - ✅ Displays featured films, events, and sponsors
   - ✅ Has navigation menu
   - ❌ But has hydration errors in console
   - ❌ Admin Portal button doesn't navigate anywhere

## Broken Components

### 1. Admin Login Page (http://localhost:3000/admin/login)
- **Issue**: Page is blank/empty
- **Likely Cause**: Missing auth context provider or import issues
- **Files exist but don't render**

### 2. Films Page (http://localhost:3000/films)
- **Issue**: "Maximum update depth exceeded" error
- **Likely Cause**: Infinite loop in useEffect or state updates
- **Critical error prevents page from loading**

### 3. Tickets Page (http://localhost:3000/tickets)
- **Issue**: Module not found: '@radix-ui/react-radio-group'
- **Likely Cause**: Missing dependency installation
- **Build error prevents page from loading**

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Dependencies
- `@radix-ui/react-radio-group` is not installed
- Possibly other Radix UI components missing
- Need to run: `npm install @radix-ui/react-radio-group`

### 2. Context Provider Issues
- Auth context might not be properly wrapped in app layout
- Site mode context may have issues
- Providers need to be properly nested

### 3. Navigation Issues
- Admin Portal button doesn't work (no onClick handler?)
- Some navigation links lead to error pages
- Mode switching between pre/post festival may not be working

### 4. React Errors
- Hydration mismatches
- Legacy behavior warnings with Next.js Link
- Maximum update depth errors (infinite loops)

## Root Causes

1. **Incomplete Integration**: The agents created many files but didn't properly integrate them
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Not all required packages were installed
3. **Context Setup**: The providers aren't properly configured in the app layout
4. **State Management**: Infinite loops suggest poorly implemented useEffect hooks
5. **Testing Gap**: The 73% test pass rate shows many components weren't properly tested

## Next Steps

1. Install missing dependencies
2. Fix the app layout to properly wrap all providers
3. Debug and fix the infinite loop in the films page
4. Ensure all context providers are properly set up
5. Fix navigation and mode switching
6. Run tests and fix remaining failures
